# sensor-fault-detection

The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long term sustainability of natural air.

This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by an APS system and negative class indicates it wasn't a APS system fault.
